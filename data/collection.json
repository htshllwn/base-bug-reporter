        "quesDetails": "Hello.\n \nI am looking to access a form on the front-end (i.e., through the console in a browser) to fill in the value for a textbox and select a value from a drop-down menu. Both of the following lines of JavaScript seem to work:\n \ndocument.getElementById('textboxID').value = 'my new value';\ndocument.getElementById('dropdownmenuID).selectedIndex = newIndex;\n \nHowever, when I click the submit/action button for the form, I receive an error message that the values are empty (i.e., no change/same as they were on page load). It's only after I click on the textbox and the drop-down menu using my mouse that the values are registered on the page and I can successfully submit the form.\n \nIs there a way to programmatically trigger the event that allows the page to recognize a change in the form values?\n \nAny help is very appreciated. Thank you kindly.\n",

        "quesDetails": "Hello,\nI'm looking to create a simple app where I can authenticate and retrieve lists from a specific sharepoint site. I've been successfully able to create a proper auth service using the reusableOffice365Login. By itself, it has been tested and logs in properly. I've also tested my integration API end point on browser to make sure that it is contacting the correct endpoints to retrieve the sharepoint list that I'm looking for. You can see the API endpoint I'm using on the requests below.\n \nIt comes up with different errors when I'm trying to test the Sharepoint integration service on the KONY fabric console because the default web service authentication (using the same reusableOffice365Login as Identity service) generates an invalid header (\"Basic + token\" instead of \"Bearer + token\"). Here's the logged request from testing:\n{\n    \"Request\": {\n        \"Headers\": {\n            \"Authorization\": \"Basic aGVpbkBrbHN0aW5jLmNvbTo0MmJpZG5lc3N0aW1FIQ==\",\n            \"Accept\": \"text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8\"\n        },\n        \"Method\": \"GET\",\n        \"Url\": \"https://mysite.sharepoint.com/sites/mysite101/Test/_api/web/lists('86B779B2-72F1-480A-A7E3-D06E3C46F946')/items\",\n        \"Payload\": {\n            \"\": [\n                \"\"\n            ]\n        }\n    }\n}\nThe above generates a bad request header error. In contrast, if I make the exact same service with no authentication via identity service, it generates the correct request header but I receive a \"Invalid issuer or signature\" error. Here's the request for that:\n{\n    \"Request\": {\n        \"Headers\": {\n            \"Authorization\": \"Bearer eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJub25jZSI6IkFRQUJBQUFBQUFDNXVuYTBFVUZnVElGOEVsYXh0V2pUWnZyUW9TMjdjUXludWw1LWNueTM5SV9kcGZsNzQyUkJFVE1YUHRyakp6dDVvdjdqWFFwajB3Rjc1M3dnQ0FVRXZZNnpwZmJQZklpalYwTUh2dmZVZ0NBQSIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2IiwieDV0IjoiaTZsR2szRlp6eFJjVWIyQzNuRVE3c3lISmxZIiwia2lkIjoiaTZsR2szRlp6eFJjVWIyQzNuRVE3c3lISmxZIn0.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.VixGrwmfI-8vLG5nmZahtUkr2ah3sJvfi0-BwBrj7AzTZNt4k9JfIWYVf4D22P4j0hOVwKG-Ae0XrI6sM_vTrdcs0lclctI8YFRmHIXJY8AAkJrYLXXAUX0lEzy7Pxl7CiefXhEOXM2FC5vo0Cycxig_oytH1swSCzAiRSPgDkd1g3lw_WGlWUr25g5r9Ym_7xwbs9sktP1nzGEB8qLtlWu_VRGwVOJ7OyPgoInCaugI6KFlObxTniEzRPBlSqvGkZBMPBe5cy17ldU2_1nYB-uzYKhwP18xS1BoBh4UALrNglVJsfiQuXiNJtXUezL9aAg-XPMWKBmA4zYfOkNxnQ\",\n            \"Accept\": \"application/json\",\n            \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\"\n        },\n        \"Method\": \"GET\",\n        \"Url\": \"https://kltech1.sharepoint.com/sites/annotate101/Test/_api/web/lists('86B779B2-72F1-480A-A7E3-D06E3C46F946')/items\",\n        \"Payload\": {\n            \"\": [\n                \"\"\n            ]\n        }\n    }\n}\nSo what are my options here?

I suppose that the service returned some data in these 20 seconds.\nThe second try was invoking custom function and get the data from that service with the JS code generated by the Fabric. I configured emulator and debugger and I see that the response is 400 whatever that is - I don't think that it's an HTTP code, because this is the success callback and 400 HTTP code is BadRequest.\n\nPlease take a look at the picture.

NOT GOOD!\n \nSecond, the Finalizer package itself has a README.txt file which says that we should be using the Python script called\nxcode-finalize-protection.py\nBUT it talks about a “partially protected library”. So we have to add a Build Phase in Xcode to run:\npath/to/finalizer/Xcode/xcode-finalize-protection.py -prefinalized-library <lib1>\nMaybe it’s a terminology issue, but a project is not a library. Still, if this is the correct approach, then what's the right lib param here?\n \nThen, I asked Kony Licensing to encrypt the public key to use in Finalizer. They replied with these files:\nfin.zip\npublic_key.dat\npublic_key.bin\n \nThe instructions to use Finalizer say we're supposed to place the fin keys and the encrypted public key in:\n \n \npath/to/workspace/__encryptionkeys\nCan anyone tell me what the correct structure for this is: Should I just drop fin.zip, public_key.dat and public_key.bin in __encryptionkeys? should I decompress fin.zip?

Is there any any methods to make it programmatically ?\n \nSecond, can i acquire the day name from calendar widget ? i means, if today is Tuesday 12/11/2018, the calendar widget will print Tuesday, 12/11/2018, and if i pick 12/12/2018 in calendar widget, the calendar will show Wednesday 12/12/2018.\n \nThird, is it able for me to make some date is not available to be selected in calendar ? Like, i don't want the calendar can select any date before current date. I need the calendar only able to select current date and beyond.\n \nI bet it can be done through Start date properties, but how to make the start date is current date programmatically ? (it is related to first question)\n \nAny help or hint will be greatly appreciated.\nThank you.\n \n",
