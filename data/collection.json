        "quesDetails": "Hello.\n \nI am looking to access a form on the front-end (i.e., through the console in a browser) to fill in the value for a textbox and select a value from a drop-down menu. Both of the following lines of JavaScript seem to work:\n \ndocument.getElementById('textboxID').value = 'my new value';\ndocument.getElementById('dropdownmenuID).selectedIndex = newIndex;\n \nHowever, when I click the submit/action button for the form, I receive an error message that the values are empty (i.e., no change/same as they were on page load). It's only after I click on the textbox and the drop-down menu using my mouse that the values are registered on the page and I can successfully submit the form.\n \nIs there a way to programmatically trigger the event that allows the page to recognize a change in the form values?\n \nAny help is very appreciated. Thank you kindly.\n",

        "quesDetails": "I’m having a little bit of a problem with App Preview on my Android phone and I’m wondering if anyone can please help? I’m trying to use kony.media.record but when I call startRecording I get a permission denied error. I’ve granted access to RECORD_AUDIO in the project settings but noticed the Visualizer app doesn’t have this permission set. I can’t see a way to grant access to the app in my phone settings. The Visualizer app has location access and kony.location works fine. Is there anything I can do get kony.media.record working on the app previewer? Let me know if you need anymore details. Thanks!\n",

        "quesDetails": "Hello,\nI'm looking to create a simple app where I can authenticate and retrieve lists from a specific sharepoint site. I've been successfully able to create a proper auth service using the reusableOffice365Login. By itself, it has been tested and logs in properly. I've also tested my integration API end point on browser to make sure that it is contacting the correct endpoints to retrieve the sharepoint list that I'm looking for. You can see the API endpoint I'm using on the requests below.\n  \nIt comes up with different errors when I'm trying to test the Sharepoint integration service on the KONY fabric console because the default web service authentication (using the same reusableOffice365Login as Identity service) generates an invalid header (\"Basic + token\" instead of \"Bearer + token\"). Here's the logged request from testing:\n \n{\n    \"Request\": {\n        \"Headers\": {\n            \"Authorization\": \"Basic aGVpbkBrbHN0aW5jLmNvbTo0MmJpZG5lc3N0aW1FIQ==\",\n            \"Accept\": \"text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8\"\n        },\n        \"Method\": \"GET\",\n        \"Url\": \"https://mysite.sharepoint.com/sites/mysite/Test/_api/web/lists('86B779B2-72F1-480A-A7E3-D06E3C46F946')/items\",\n        \"Payload\": {\n            \"\": [\n                \"\"\n            ]\n        }\n    }\n}\n \nThe above generates a bad request header error. In contrast, if I make the exact same service with no authentication via identity service, it generates the correct request header but I receive a \"Invalid issuer or signature\" error. Here's the request for that:\n{\n    \"Request\": {\n        \"Headers\": {\n            \"Authorization\": \"Bearer eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJub25jZSI6IkFRQUJBQUFBQUFDNXVuYTBFVUZnVElGOEVsYXh0V2pUWnZyUW9TMjdjUXludWw1LWNueTM5SV9kcGZsNzQyUkJFVE1YUHRyakp6dDVvdjdqWFFwajB3Rjc1M3dnQ0FVRXZZNnpwZmJQZklpalYwTUh2dmZVZ0NBQSIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2IiwieDV0IjoiaTZsR2szRlp6eFJjVWIyQzNuRVE3c3lISmxZIiwia2lkIjoiaTZsR2szRlp6eFJjVWIyQzNuRVE3c3lISmxZIn0.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.VixGrwmfI-8vLG5nmZahtUkr2ah3sJvfi0-BwBrj7AzTZNt4k9JfIWYVf4D22P4j0hOVwKG-Ae0XrI6sM_vTrdcs0lclctI8YFRmHIXJY8AAkJrYLXXAUX0lEzy7Pxl7CiefXhEOXM2FC5vo0Cycxig_oytH1swSCzAiRSPgDkd1g3lw_WGlWUr25g5r9Ym_7xwbs9sktP1nzGEB8qLtlWu_VRGwVOJ7OyPgoInCaugI6KFlObxTniEzRPBlSqvGkZBMPBe5cy17ldU2_1nYB-uzYKhwP18xS1BoBh4UALrNglVJsfiQuXiNJtXUezL9aAg-XPMWKBmA4zYfOkNxnQ\",\n            \"Accept\": \"application/json\",\n            \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\"\n        },\n        \"Method\": \"GET\",\n        \"Url\": \"https://mysite.sharepoint.com/sites/mysite/Test/_api/web/lists('86B779B2-72F1-480A-A7E3-D06E3C46F946')/items\",\n        \"Payload\": {\n            \"\": [\n                \"\"\n            ]\n        }\n    }\n}\nSo what are my options here?
